      <li><b>Burst Statistics</b>
        <p>Burst statistics involves the quantitative analysis of bursty patterns in data, aiming to identify,
          quantify, and characterize the bursts or spikes in activity. It encompasses various statistical techniques
          and measures designed to capture the temporal dynamics, intensity, and duration of bursts, as well as their
          underlying mechanisms and implications.</p>
        <ul className='privacy_list'>

            in data by quantifying various properties of bursts, such as their frequency, amplitude, duration, and

          <li>Bot Protection: reCAPTCHA helps protect websites from automated bot attacks, such as brute force
            attacks, credential stuffing, and malicious bot activity. By requiring users to solve challenges that are
            difficult for bots to pass, reCAPTCHA adds an additional layer of security to websites and reduces the
