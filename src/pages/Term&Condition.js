                      You may be bound by additional contracts related to your relationship with us or any products or services that you
                      receive from us. If any provisions of the additional contracts conflict with any provisions of these Terms, the
                      provisions of these additional contracts will control and prevail.</p>

                  <h4>2. Binding</h4>
                  <p> By registering with, accessing, or otherwise using this website, you hereby agree to be bound by these Terms and

                  <h4>6. Refund and Return policy</h4>
                  <h5>6.1 Right of withdrawal</h5>


                  <p>You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.

                      To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an
                      unequivocal statement (for example a letter sent by post, fax, or email). Our contact details can be found below.
                      You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory.

                      You can also electronically fill in and submit the model withdrawal form or any other unequivocal statement on our
                      website.

                      If you use this option, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable
                      medium (for example by email) without delay.

                      To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of
                      the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>

                  <h5>6.2 Effects of withdrawal</h5>

                  <p>If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse you all payments received from you, including the costs of
                      delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other
                      than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later
                      than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will
                      carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction unless you
                      have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

                      You are only liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling other than what is necessary
                      to establish the nature, characteristics, and functioning of the goods.

                      Please note that there are some legal exceptions to the right to withdraw, and some items can therefore not be
                      returned or exchanged. We will let you know if this applies in your particular case.</p>

                  <h4>7. Idea submission</h4>
                  <p>Do not submit any ideas, inventions, works of authorship, or other information that can be considered your own
                      intellectual property that you would like to present to us unless we have first signed an agreement regarding the
                      intellectual property or a non-disclosure agreement. If you disclose it to us absent such written agreement, you
                      grant to us a worldwide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, store, adapt,
                      publish, translate and distribute your content in any existing or future media.</p>
